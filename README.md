# DebugExtensions
A blueprint function library for Unreal Engine, extends a lot of the native nodes typicall used for debugging. For example, drawing debug shapes or doing line traces. It exposes parameters otherwise only accessible via C++, such as drawing at different scene depths and more.

All drawing methods now also have a `WorldTransform` node, so you can conveniently draw shapes at either world-space or local-space coordinates.

A list of extended methods can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mmAiz0LT7JU6URE-P1SELtAG2nZMEfcrxsN-Pe4XZyg).
